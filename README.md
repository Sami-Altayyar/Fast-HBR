# Fast-HBR
Fast-HBR is duplicate reads removing tool from fastq and fasta files.
Fast-HBR is fast and memory-efficient because it does not need to store reads in string form on the memory. Instead of that, it will store their hash value as integer. Moreover, it will write directly to the output file and remove duplicate reads on-the-fly.

# Usage 
to remove duplicate reads from single end files
